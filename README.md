Your team will be required to understand users’ requirements and build a web-based solution that they are. The web-based solution must provide a frontend application which is supported by a respective backend system.At the end of the module, your team will be required to submit a team video demonstration of your web-based solution which will contribute 10% of the module grade. Also, you will be required to write and submit an individual reflective report which will contribute 50% towards your final module grade. The remaining 40% of the module grade is awarded for the written examination which will take place during the December exam fortnight. The work will be assessed using the attached grading rubric. 
- 10% - Team Video Demonstration, 50% - Individual Reflective Report, 40% - Written Examination

- Please the course coordinator of SHAPE for disability support. 
- Any student requiring an extension or deferral with solid reason (i.e., medical grounds) should contact the course coordinator of SHAPE. 
- SHAPE cannot take responsibility for any coursework lost or corrupted on disks, laptops or personal computer. Students should therefore regularly back-up any work and are advised to save it on the SHAPE system. 
- If there are technical or performance issues that prevent students submitting coursework through the online coursework submission system on the day of a coursework deadline, an appropriate extension to the coursework submission deadline will be agreed. This extension will normally be 24 hours or the next working day if the deadline falls on a Friday or over the weekend period. This will be communicated via email and as a SHAPE Moodle announcement. 
- Assignments that are more than 10% over the word limit will result in a deduction of 10% of the mark i.e. a mark of 60% will lead to a reduction of 6% to 54%. The word limit includes quotations, but excludes the bibliography, reference list and tables.
